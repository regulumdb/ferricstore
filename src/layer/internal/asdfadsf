blank nodes:
- we have an id
- need t be able to tell if a given id is a blank node

indexes:
- we have an index num
- we need to be able to tell if this index num is covered
- need to find the layer this index num is in
- need to find up to what index num each layer goes
- index_id = {l=layer_for(index_num);(index_num-l.parent.max_index)+l.num_predicates
